# Almost C64 - A C64 emulator written in javascript

A C64 emulator, what else, because C64 was and still is the best home computer. Yeah, better than your PC.

I developed a C# C64 emulator some years ago (in 2015, I think), but C# is so 2010. So I took my beloved javascript and, re-using the 6502 core from almostNES, a C64 javascript emulator was ready in a few days. This new emulator has SID sound (a thing that the C# had not) and is already capable of generating SID-ish sounds. SID was so ahead for its time (remember that it has been made in 1982, so it's a chip that is almost 40 years old).
